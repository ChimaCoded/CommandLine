(Almost) everything is a file

In a Unix operating system almost everything is
a file. Unknown to us until we've already been 
using these three (hidden) files from the very 
beginning:

standard-input (std-in) - connected to the keyboard
standard-output (std-out) - connected to the screen
standard-error (std-err) - connected to the screen
